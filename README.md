Project Overview
Eleta is an Arduino-based smart robot that can:

Execute movement commands like forward, backward, left, and right.
Draw geometric shapes such as circles and squares.
Display commands on an LCD screen.
Perform a ‚Äúdance‚Äù routine when prompted.
This project is beginner-friendly and highly customizable.

Features
Voice-Controlled: Bluetooth-enabled for seamless communication.
LCD Feedback: Displays commands in real time.
Shape Drawing: Moves in pre-defined patterns like circles or squares.
Customizable: Add sensors, cameras, or new movements to enhance its capabilities.
Components Needed
Here‚Äôs the list of components you‚Äôll need to build Eleta:

Component	Quantity	Description
Arduino (ESP32 or UNO)	1	The brain of the robot.
L298N Motor Driver	1	Controls the motors.
DC Motors	2	For movement.
Bluetooth Module (HC-05)	1	Enables voice command communication.
LCD Screen (16x2, I2C)	1	Displays the received commands.
Power Supply/Battery	1	Powers the robot.
Jumper Wires & Breadboard	As needed	For connections.
Chassis	1	Base to mount the components.
Getting Started
Hardware Setup
Follow these steps to assemble the robot:

Motor Connections:

Connect the DC motors to the L298N motor driver module.
Attach the motor driver module to the Arduino using the appropriate pins.
LCD Screen:

Connect the LCD to the Arduino via I2C (SDA, SCL).
Bluetooth Module:

Attach the RX and TX pins of the Bluetooth module to the Arduino.
Power Supply:

Connect the battery pack to the motor driver and Arduino.
Refer to the wiring diagram for detailed connections.

Software Setup
Install Arduino IDE:
Download and install the Arduino IDE from arduino.cc.

Add Required Libraries:

LiquidCrystal_I2C: For LCD communication.
Upload the Code:

Open Eleta.ino from this repository in Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port.
Upload the code to your Arduino.
Voice Commands
Eleta responds to these voice commands sent via a Bluetooth app:

Command	Action
F	Move Forward
B	Move Backward
L	Turn Left
R	Turn Right
C	Draw a Circle
Q	Draw a Square
D	Dance
S	Stop Movement
Use any Bluetooth terminal app to send these commands.

Troubleshooting
If Eleta doesn‚Äôt work as expected, try the following:

Check Connections: Ensure all components are connected securely.
Bluetooth Pairing Issues: Confirm that the Bluetooth module is paired with your smartphone.
Debugging Code: Look for error messages in the Arduino IDE and ensure all libraries are installed.
Power Issues: Verify that the battery pack provides sufficient power to the motors and Arduino.
Customization Ideas
Take Eleta to the next level with these ideas:

Add obstacle avoidance sensors for autonomous navigation.
Integrate a camera for real-time object detection.
Program advanced movement patterns like zigzag or spiral paths.
